Grails also supports data binding of JSON requests to command objects. From a client standpoint it works in a similar fashion
where we can fill the request with JSON data and then invoke the action method, which has a command object. We will save
a new student two different ways:

- 1) use a domain object that will be be converted to JSON automatically
- 2) declare a JSON object directly.

[source, groovy]
.src/test/groovy/grails/controller/testing/StudentControllerSpec.groovy
----
    //...
    void "test save with json request - domain conversion"() {

        when: "json request is sent with domain conversion"
            request.method = 'POST'
            request.json = new Student(name: "Nirav", grade: 87)
            controller.save()

        then:
            Student.count() == 1
    }

    void "test save with json request - raw json"() {
        when: "json request is sent with domain conversion"
            request.method = 'POST'
            request.json = '{"name":"Rina","grade":85}'
            controller.save()

        then:
            Student.count() == 1
    }
